# Tracking Eye (Classic)

This add-on adds a handy tracking icon to your minimap with a button that lets you easily switch between tracking types.

💀 When you resurrect, Tracking Eye will attempt to reapply the tracking ability you were using before you died.

❗ Note that while we can’t add a menu to the default "Tracking Eye" functionality in Classic, we can make the mini-map button large enough to overlap the default “Tracking Eye.” It’s a bit of a hack, but it’s the only way to make it work in the Classic Era!
